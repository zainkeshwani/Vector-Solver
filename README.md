# Vector-Solver
This program, given a vector (in numerous ways, depending on what is known), will perform calculations with said vector.
In my AP Physics class, there were a lot of vector calculations that needed to be done in order to get to a final answer. As a result of this, I made this caclulator to help me in doing so. This calculator can do basic operations such as addition and subtraction, but also can find dot and cross products, the angle between two vectors, and much more.
